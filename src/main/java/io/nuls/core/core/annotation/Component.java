 * 该注解用来标识类型，当类型上标记了本注解，系统会在初始化阶段实例化该对象，并且对需要自动装载的属性进行赋值
 * 该注解标识的类型生成的对象不使用动态代理的方式实例化，不会被默认拦截器拦截
 * This annotation is used to identify the type, and when the annotation is marked on the type,
 * the system instantiates the object in the initialization phase and assigns the attributes that need to be automatically loaded.
 * The type generated by the annotation identifier is not instantiated using a dynamic proxy and is not intercepted by the default interceptor.
